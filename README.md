# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this module was to use JavaScript's leaflet library and Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data. To accomplish this, we learned to perform the following tasks:
- create and merge branches from GitHub
- add, commit and push data onto specific branches
- make API requests to a server to host geographical maps
- use JavaScript and the d3 library to populate geographical maps with geoJSON data 
- add multiple mao layers and overlay
- add user interface controls
- add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps
- display maps on local servers
